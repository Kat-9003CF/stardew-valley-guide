#StarDew Valley Visitor's Guide

This is an app built as a companion app for the game, Stardew Valley.  

Stardew Valley is an immersive RPG with lots of storylines, items and characters to engage with, and for the casual player this can lead to 'works-in-progress' being forgotten.

This is a minimum viable project.  Players can:

- select a character and find out information about them which helps you build friendship with them.  (Friendship level is dummy data at present)
- find out when key in-game events are happening using the calendar.
- keep track of items needed to complete in-game 'bundles'.

At present this is a front end app as it was my first project, but I plan to add a back end database to allow players to update friendship levels with characters, as well as keep track of the 'bundles' and which items have been collected.
